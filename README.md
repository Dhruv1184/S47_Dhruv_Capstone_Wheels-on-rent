# S47_Dhruv_Capstone_Wheels-on-rent
My Topic is Wheels-on-rent
# Project idea:-
1. User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in securely to access the platform's features.
2. Vehicle Listing: Owners can list their vehicles for rent or sale, providing details such as make, model, year, price, availability, and photos.
3. Contact and Communication: Users interested in a vehicle can directly contact the owner through the platform to inquire about renting or purchasing the vehicle.

# AIM:-
1. It generates revenue for vehicle owners who have vehicles that are unused and have been idle for an extended period.
2. It addresses the issue for individuals who require a vehicle urgently.

# Roadmap:-
1. first I am going to work on backend side by connect my Database with my project.
2. Then setup all the http method (i.e Get, Post, Put, Delete).
3. Then Deploy backend.
4. Start working on front end part i.e client side.
5. After completing my frontend part I am going to use 3rd party authentication and autherization by google.
6. Deploy frontend.
